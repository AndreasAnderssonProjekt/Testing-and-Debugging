Bugs are inevitable. As long as code is written by ordinary people, insidious bugs and defects will find a way to sneak into the core of the program. In the book "Why programs fail" Andreas Zeller presents a systematic debugging framework that do not consist of constant hair-pulling from your scalp. In order to more easily recollect the strucutre of this framework we introduce the acronym TRAFFIC.
//
TRACK the problem.
//
REPRODUCE the failure.
AUTOMATE and simplify the test case.
FIND the possible infection origin.
FOCUS on the most relevant of these origins.
ISOLATE the infection chain.
CORRECT the defect.
