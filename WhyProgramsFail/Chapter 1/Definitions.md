The term bug is often a too broad of a term that encompasses all types of misbehavior such as incorrect code, incorrect state of a variable and incorrect behavior.
To make the terminology more specific we introduce the following three types of bugs:

* Defects - Faults in the program code.
* Infection - An incorrect program state.
* Failure - An incorrect program behavior.
